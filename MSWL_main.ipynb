    "Just over 71 percent of complaints made against CPD are handled internally by BIA. These cases are handled internally and as such generally stay out of public view. This is evident from the head of our data, where we see that every case assigned to BIA has no more than a complaint date and a log number. While it is possible to get more information on these cases individually, it isn't feasible to do so on the scale which we are working at. While no abuse of power by those tasked with law enforcment should be considered minor the cases that fall under BIA jurisdiction tend to be less severe than those assigned to IPRA and COPA. The significant gap in cases assigned to COPA and IPRA can be explained by COPA's relative youth. While both organizations operated at the same time for a short period COPA has since replaced IPRA completely. An increase in scrutiny of police abuses of power came following the release of a dashcam footage of the shooting of LaQuan McDonald in 2014. IPRA came under fire not just specifically for thatcase but for failing to keep police accountable and was later replaced by COPA."

In addition the cases are obviously different and as such are hard to compare exactly.
